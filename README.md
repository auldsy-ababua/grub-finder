# GrubFinder - Easifying Your Restaurant Search!

### _URL_:<br>
https://grub-finder.herokuapp.com/

### _API's_ _USED_:<br>
1. [Yelp API 2.0](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)

### _SUMMARY_:<br> 
The function of the app is basic: input a zip code and a category of restaurant into the form and hit enter, then watch as the page populates with results, each featuring images, links, name, and star-rating to help guide you in your search. 
This was my first experience utilizing Facebook's front-end framework React. I also wanted to use Yelp's API in order to better understand API implementation and also because I am a foodie who never knows where to eat.
For these reasons and because of time constraints on the project, creating a very simple suggestion app was an obvious choice. 

### _FUTURE FEATURES_:<br>
1. Each result will provide a link for online ordering (if available). 
2. App will utilize Yelp's "Open Now" functionality to only show you the top 20 results of restaurants open at the moment of search. 

### _TECHNOLOGY USED_:<br>
1. Server-side: Node/Express<br> 
2. Client-side: HTML5, LESS, [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
